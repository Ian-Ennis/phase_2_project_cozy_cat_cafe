# Cozy-Cat-Cafe


## Project Concept

Cozy Cat Cafe is a place where one can unwind, browse through books, and pet (or get bitten) by some crazy cats (we have those here...) and submit adoption forms for the non-crazy ones.

## User stories

-As a user, I should be able to see all of the books available in Cozy Cat Cafe.<br/>
-As a user, I should be able to use a search bar to find the book I am looking for and have the results display in the book container.<br/>
-As a user, I should be able to generate a new cat companion when I click a button.<br/>
-As a user, I should be able to see the Cozy Cat Cafeâ€™s business contact information at all times.<br/>
